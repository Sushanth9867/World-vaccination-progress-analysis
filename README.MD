Through this project, I aim to understand how vaccination rates are progressing in the world by answering different questions like 
Which country started vaccinating its citizens first?
Which country has the highest vaccinated people?
What are the different categories of vaccines offered?
Which vaccine is used by various countries?

1) The first stage is data preparation and cleaning
2) Then we proceed to indepth analysis of understanding vaccination count by country , vaccine types available and different vaccines used in different countries
3) Third step is answering the questions by visualization in seaborn library by using different types of charts.
